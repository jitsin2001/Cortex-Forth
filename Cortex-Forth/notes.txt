16:49z New workflow

Ctrl A X - end minicom - prerequisite to firmware
upload in Arduino IDE

Serial (not Serial1) is the new output target in
the arduino code base - temporary measure to
increase firmware iteration speed. ;)



15:29z First char does not echo immediately; needs
second char typed before it is shown.

Control J works better than ENTER does - it will
provoke an Ok prompt, for example.
