This is a variant that talks via TX/RX pair, to
CP2104 (PiUART) rather than via /dev/ttyACM0.

Device: /dev/ttyUSB0 at 9600 (baud rate should
be arbitrary .. perhaps).

Project works well, and simply - very small change
was made in just a few minutes.

Existing hardware setup for another project was
leveraged (CP2104 and Feather M0 Express - there
is also a Segger JLink EDU hookup handy).
