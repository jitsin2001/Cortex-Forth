The 9termer branch works with 9term and via
the USART (both together).

It's designed to deal with strict timing
constraints (mainly to avoid dropped characters).

Keyboard input latency can suffer if the timings
are not optimized.

Current platforms are Trinket M0 (for the M0 Terminal program)
and ItsyBitsyM4 (for this program, Cortex-Forth.ino).
