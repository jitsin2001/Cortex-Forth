Installation

Quick Check: Same version?

The documentation assumes you are using Release 0.2.0-alpha.3
with a 'shred' of abn-739.  The shred changes frequently, and
is a quick reference to the current version of the program,
independent of other means to reference this.

If you glance at the 'abn' number/version when the program
starts printing information to your terminal, you'll generally
be up to speed in identifying which version is currently loaded
onto the target board (give or take several commits, as the abn
number is only updated a few times each development session).

It generally changes at least once per calendar date of development.

See 'Versioning' (below) for a bit more on referencing which
version is documented here.

    This release is interim.  Has further factoring of the Forth sources.
    
    Support for \ comments is now available.  Better support
    for ubiquitous line endings (use 0x0d 0x0a to end all
    source code lines).
