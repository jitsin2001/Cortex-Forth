// Seems to compile at both the keyboard (interactively)
// and from a file!  Monday 12 Aug 00:29z


// OLDER:

// Working.  Won't compile from a file source, but
// will execute, correctly, most words except for
// the colon word (':') due to the way it erases
// what was held in tib.


// WORKS - have new ability to read from a file!
// very sketchy, but the mechanism works (somewhat)
// as of 17:13z 11 Aug.  Continue. ;)
